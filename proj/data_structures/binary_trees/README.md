# Binary Tree


## Definition

 A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children.
 A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below.
 Ordering of these children (e.g., by drawing them on a plane) makes possible to distinguish left child from right child.
 But this still doesn't distinguish between a node with left but not a right child from a one with right but no left child.
