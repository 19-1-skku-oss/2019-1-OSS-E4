## BFS 's Definition

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

It uses the opposite strategy as depth-first search, which instead explores the highest-depth nodes first before being forced to backtrack and expand shallower nodes.

BFS and its application in finding connected components of graphs were invented in 1945 by Konrad Zuse, in his (rejected) Ph.D. thesis on the Plankalk√ºl programming language, but this was not published until 1972. It was reinvented in 1959 by Edward F. Moore, who used it to find the shortest path out of a maze, and later developed by C. Y. Lee into a wire routing algorithm (published 1961).

## Source Code by C

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<limits.h>
#include<string.h>


//Structure for storing a graph
struct Graph{
	int vertexNum;
	int** edges;
};

//Constructs a graph with V vertices and E edges
void createGraph(struct Graph* G,int V){
		G->vertexNum = V;
		G->edges =(int**) malloc(V * sizeof(int*));
		for(int i=0; i<V; i++){
			G->edges[i] = (int*) malloc(V * sizeof(int));
			for(int j=0; j<V; j++)
				G->edges[i][j] = INT_MAX;
			G->edges[i][i] = 0;
		}		
}

//Adds the given edge to the graph 
void addEdge(struct Graph* G, int src, int dst, int weight){
	G->edges[src][dst] = weight;
}

//BFS Travel
int row, col, visited[1000000], order[1000000];
int head, tail;

struct Data {
	int now,v;
	int enque(int cur, int lv) {
		if (visited[cur])
			return 0;
		now = cur, c = nc, v = lv;
		visited[cur] = 1;
		order[cur] = v;
		tail++;
	}
}que[LM * LM];
int BFS()
{
	for (; head < tail; head++)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i <= G->vertexNum; i++) {
			if (G->edges[cur][i] != 0 && G->edges[cur][i] != INT_MAX) {
				Data& t = que[head];
				que[tail].enque(t.r + dr[i] t.v + 1);
			}
		}
	}
	return 0;
}

//Driver Function
int main(){
	int V,E,gsrc;
	int src,dst,weight;
	struct Graph G;
	printf("Enter number of vertices: ");
	scanf("%d",&V);
	printf("Enter number of edges: ");
	scanf("%d",&E);
	createGraph(&G,V);
	for(int i=0; i<E; i++){
		printf("\nEdge %d \nEnter source: ",i+1);
		scanf("%d",&src);
		printf("Enter destination: ");
		scanf("%d",&dst);
		printf("Enter weight: ");
		scanf("%d",&weight);
		addEdge(&G, src, dst, weight);
	}
	printf("\nEnter source:");
	scanf("%d",&gsrc);
	DFS(gsrc,0);

	printf("All Vertices Travel Complete By DFS!\n");
	return 0;
}
