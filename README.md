### About Project

 
Out Project is 'C Language Algorithm Library'


 This project is about Algorithm with C. There are many categories like searching, sorting, hash, data structures, exercism, etc. We will commit new & edit C file. When we finish this project, This can make amateur study easily.


# What is Algorithm?
An algorithm is a detailed series of instructions for carrying out an operation or solving a problem. In a non-technical approach, we use algorithms in everyday tasks, such as a recipe to bake a cake or a do-it-yourself handbook.

Technically, computers use algorithms to list the detailed instructions for carrying out an operation. For example, to compute an employee’s paycheck, the computer uses an algorithm. To accomplish this task, appropriate data must be entered into the system. In terms of efficiency, various algorithms are able to accomplish operations or problem solving easily and quickly.


You can see the algorithm what you want in our 'C Language Algorithm Library'
